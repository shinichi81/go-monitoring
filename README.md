# Clean Architecture in Go
An example of "Clean Architecture" in Go to demonstrate developing a testable
application that can be run on AppEngine with Google Cloud Storage or with
traditional hosting and MongoDB for storage (but not limited to either).

There are a number of different application architectures that are all simlar
variations on the same theme which is to have clean separation of concerns and
dependencies that follow the best practices of "the dependency invesion principle":

A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

B. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

Variations of the approach include:

* [The Clean Architecture](https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) advocated by Robert Martin ('Uncle Bob')
* Ports & Adapters or [Hexagonal Architecture](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture) by Alistair Cockburn
* [Onion Architecture](http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/) by Jeffrey Palermo

From more in-depth practical application of many of the ideas I can strongly
recommend the excellent book [Implementing Domain-Driven Design](http://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0321834577)
by Vaughn Vernon that goes into far greater detail.

Besides the clean codebase, the approaches also bring other advantages - significant
parts of the system can be unit tested quickly and easily without having to fire
up the full web stack, something that is often difficult when the dependencies
go the wrong way (if you need a database and a web-server running to make your
tests work, you're doing it wrong).

I'd used it before in the world of .NET but forgot about it after moving to coding
more in Python. After switching languages again (yeah, right) to the wonderful
world of go I came across a blog post which re-ignited my interest in it:
[Applying The Clean Architecture to Go applications](http://manuel.kiessling.net/2012/09/28/applying-the-clean-architecture-to-go-applications/)

It's a great read but I found the example a little overly-complex with too much of
the focus on relational database model parts and at the same time it was light
on some issues I wanted to resolve such as switching between different storage types
and web UI or framework (and Go has so many of those to chose from!).

I've also been looking for a way to make my application usable both standalone
and on AppEngine as well as being easier to test, so this seemed like a good opportunity
to do some experimenting and this is what I came up with as a prototype which I've
hopefully simplified to show the techniques.

## Dependency Rings
We've all heard of n-tier or layered architecture, especially if you've come
from the world of .NET or Java and it's unfair that it gets a bad rep. Probably
because it was often implemented so poorly with the typical mistake of everything
relying on the database layer at the bottom which made software rigid, difficult
to test and closely tied to the vendor's database implementation (hardly surprising
that they promoted it so hard).

Reversing the dependencies though has a wonderful transformative effect on your
code. Here is my interpretation of the layers or rings implemented using the Go
language (or 'Golang' for Google).

### Domain
At the center of the dependencies is the domain. These are the business objects
or entities and should represent and encapsulate the fundamental business rules
such as "can a closed customer account create a new order?". There is usually a
single root object that represents the system and which has the factory methods
to create other objects (which in turn may have their own methods to create others).
This is where the domain-driven design lives.

Looking at this should give you an idea of the business model for the application
and what the system is working with. This package allows code such as unit tests
to excercise the core parts of the app for testing to ensure that basic rules are
enforced.

### Engine / Use-Cases
The application level rules and use-cases orchestrate the domain model and add richer
rules and logic including persistence. I prefer the term engine for this package
because it is the engine of what the app actually does. The rules implemented at this
level should not affect the domain model rules but obviously may depend on them.
The rules of the application also shouldn't rely on the UI or the persistence
frameworks being used.

Why would the business rules change depending on what UI framework is the new flavour
of the month or if we want to change from an RDBMS to MongoDB or some cloud datastore?
Those are implementation details that pull the levers of the use cases or are used by
the engine via abstract interfaces.

### Interface Adapters
These are concerned with converting data from a form that the use-cases handle to
whatever the external framework and drivers use. A use-case may expect a request
struct with a set of parameters and return a response struct with the results. The
public facing part of the app is more likely to expect to send requests as JSON or
http form posts and return JSON or rendered HTML. The database may return results
in a structure that needs to be adapted into something the rest of the app can use.

### Frameworks and Drivers
These are the ports that allow the system to talk to 'outside things' which could be
a database for persistence or a web server for the UI. None of the inner use cases
or domain entities should know about the implementation of these layers and they may
change over time because ... well, we used to store data in SQL, then MongoDB and
now cloud datastores. Changing the storage should not change the application or any
of the business rules. I tend to call these "providers" because ... well, .NET.
